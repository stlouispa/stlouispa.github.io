The Parent Association (PA) is the structure through which parents and guardians in St. 
Louis Infant and Senior Primary Schools can work together for the best possible education of our children. 
We work closely with the Principals of both schools to build an effective partnership between the home and school.  
The PA committee is elected at an AGM each year to manage events and carry out the PA’s tasks.

This year’s PA Committee consists of the following parents and guardians:

* Co-Chairs: Maureen O’Neill and Tanya Ferrie
* Secretary: Paul Finlay
* Treasurer: Anna Lynch
* Communications Officer, Joanna Kavanagh
* Helen Smith
* Jef Bucas
* Kim Porcelli
* Mary Jo Biggs
* Yoshiko Misawa
* Leahanne Harrington
* Laura Reynolds
* Rikki Llyod
* Veronique Poisson
* Claudia Martinez
* Flore Bouhey Dwan
* Rachel Coats
* Lorraine Byrne

## Join the PA Committee

St Louis is a diverse school and it is important that this diversity is represented on our Parents Association Committee. 
So, whatever your nationality or gender, whether you are stay at home parent or working full-time, whether you are a single parent or part of same sex family please consider joining the committee and get involved in helping your child’s school.

**You don’t need any special skills, just a willingness to get involved as much as you can.** 
You might have a few hours here and there to help out with one event, or you might wish to take a position on the Committee (such as Secretary, Treasurer, Communications). 
You can get involved as much or as little as you want and so please don’t rule yourself out if you are working or parenting full-time.

Email us at any time at pa.stlouisschools@gmail.com. 
Again, you can commit as much or as little time as you have available … any help at all is very much appreciated!
