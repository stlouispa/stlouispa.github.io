Contact us at any time by email at pa.stlouisschools@gmail.com.

While you’re here, please considering joining the PA, or volunteering to help out with some of our events. St Louis is a diverse school and it’s important that this diversity is represented on our Parents Association Committee. So, whatever your nationality or gender, whether you are stay at home parent or working full-time, whether you are a single parent or part of same sex family please consider joining the committee and get involved in helping your child’s school. 

**You don’t need any special skills, just a willingness to get involved.** You might have a few hours here and there to help out with one event, or you might wish to take a position on the Committee (such as Secretary, Treasurer, Communications). You can get involved as much or as little as you want and so please don’t rule yourself out if you are working or parenting full-time.

Email us at any time at pa.stlouisschools@gmail.com. Again, you can commit as much or as little time as you have available … any help at all is very much appreciated!
