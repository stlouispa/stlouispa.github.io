The PA usually organises a number of after-school classes & activities throughout the year, including indoor soccer, swimming and tennis. These are in addition to after-school classes that are also offered directly by the school.

Keep an eye out for our emails and text messages with more information and details of how to sign your child up to these activities.

Activities can be paid for through the PA’s [easypaymentsplus](https://pay.easypaymentsplus.com/feepay1v2.aspx?id=885)


If you have a particular skill that you are willing to offer as part of our after school activities, get in touch with the PA (**pa.stlouisschools@gmail.com**). Parent-led teaching has secured many worthwhile initiatives for the school over the years such as coding, crafting and yoga.
