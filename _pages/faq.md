### What is the Parent Association?

The Parent Association (PA) is the structure through which parents and guardians in St. Louis Infant and Senior Primary Schools can work together for the best possible education of our children. The PA committee is elected at an AGM each year to manage events and carry out the PAâ€™s tasks. We work closely with the Principals of both schools to build an effective partnership between the home and school. 

### What do we do?

Our two main tasks are to make our voices heard on matters relating to the school and to run events and activities to help children and parents get more involved at the school. Some events that we do are purely social and others have a fundraising focus.

### Does the PA organise After School Activities? 

Yes the PA usually organises a number of after-school classes & activities throughout the year, including indoor soccer, swimming and tennis. These are in addition to after school classes that are also offered directly by the school.
If you have a particular skill that you are willing to offer as part of our after school activities, get in touch with the PA (pa.stlouisschools@gmail.com). Parent-led teaching has secured many worthwhile initiatives for the school over the years such as coding, crafting and yoga.

### How can I get involved?

Our PA events & activities only happen with the generous input of parents and there are many ways you can get involved.

**Volunteer at Events**

We will need volunteers for various events throughout the year. Close to the time of the event we will put a call out for volunteers, so if you are available let us know. 

**Join the PA Committee**

Please consider joining the PA Committee & sharing your skills & time. Email us at pa.stlouisschools@gmail.com. You can commit as much or as little time as you have available, any help at all is very much appreciated.

**Donate Prizes**

Maybe your business or company could donate a prize for our fundraising events. We usually have 2 big raffles throughout the year and are always delighted to highlight any businesses who help us out. We are also always looking for prizes for children throughout the year. 

**Come Along & Support Our Events**
